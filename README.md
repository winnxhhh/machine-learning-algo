# machine-learning-algo
 This individual project was made for our Machine Learning midterm module.
 
 We compared the performances of different machine learning classification algorithms- k-Nearest Neighbours (kNN), Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Decision Trees. kNN and Naive Bayes were coded from scratch while Logistic Regression and Decision Trees were implemented using the scikit-learn library. 

 The whole project is done in a Jupyter Notebook, with descriptive markdown cells between the code cells, and is structured as a report. We tested each algorithm on the Wine dataset that is built into the scikit-learn library, and found that the best performing algorithm was the Logistic Regression model, followed by the kNN model.
